We apply for the following three badges:
1. Evaluated - Functional
2. Evaluated - Reusable
3. Available

We believe our artifact deserves an "Evaluated - Functional" badge because it is well documented (we specifically describe its contents in the README file), complete, and exercisable (we provide all the artifacts/data/scripts needed to build/run our tool and replicate our tool evaluation). 

Additionally, we believe our artifact deserves an "Evaluated - Reusable" badge because it is well structured (into directories and sub-directories) and described carefully in the README file (see the ESEC/FSE'22 Replication Package section for more details). In this way, researchers and tool builders can understand and easily reuse the artifact.

Finally, our artifact is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/SageSELab/AidUI) and has been archived on Zenodo.
